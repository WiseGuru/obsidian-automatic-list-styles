# Ordered List Style

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

When viewing ordered lists in read mode, they will automatically shift styles with level of indent. The following styles are set by default: 

- decimal
- lower-alpha
- lower-roman
- upper-alpha
- upper-roman
- decimal-leading-zero
- disc
- circle
- square

## Upgrade Path

I would like to add a settings page that allows users to customize their list styles, using any of the [CSS list style types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) available, but I haven't gotten that to work properly yet.
