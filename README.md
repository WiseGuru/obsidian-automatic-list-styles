# Ordered List Style

> **NOTE**: This plugin is being deprecated in favor of [Lawlist](https://github.com/willem-schlieter/lawlist) by Willem Schlieter. Lawlist supports both Edit and Read modes, as well as custom lists.

> I will continue to publish security updates for this plugin but encourage you to switch to Lawlist once it's been published with Obsidian.

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

When viewing ordered lists in read mode, they will automatically shift styles with level of indent. The following styles are set by default: 

- decimal
- lower-alpha
- lower-roman
- upper-alpha
- upper-roman
- decimal-leading-zero
- disc
- circle
- square

Please note this does not impact edit mode, just read mode.

## Upgrade Path

I would like to add a settings page that allows users to customize their list styles, using any of the [CSS list style types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) available, but I haven't gotten that to work properly yet.
